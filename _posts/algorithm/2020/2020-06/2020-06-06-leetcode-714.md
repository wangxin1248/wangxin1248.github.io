# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

## 题目描述

Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)

Return the maximum profit you can make.

Example 1:

```s
Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
Buying at prices[0] = 1
Selling at prices[3] = 8
Buying at prices[4] = 4
Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

Note:

- 0 < prices.length <= 50000.
- 0 < prices[i] < 50000.
- 0 <= fee < 50000.

## 解题思路

### 方法一：动态规划

本题是股票系列问题之一，按照[股票问题的通用解决方法](https://wangxin1248.github.io/algorithm/2020/05/leetcode-stock.html)可以很快的写出对应的解法。

#### 算法实现-Java

```java
class Solution{
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices,int fee){
        int n = prices.length;
        // 定义初始状态
        int dp_i_0 = 0;// 初始情况不持有股票的收益是0
        int dp_i_1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;// 初始情况持有股票的收益是负数，因为不可能持有股票
        // 开始进行状态转移
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            int temp = dp_i_0;
            dp_i_0 = Math.max(dp_i_0,dp_i_1+prices[i]);
            dp_i_1 = Math.max(dp_i_1,temp-prices[i]-fee);
        }
        return dp_i_0;
    }
}
```

#### 算法性能分析

- 时间复杂度：O(n)
- 空间复杂度：O(1)
